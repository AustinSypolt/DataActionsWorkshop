## Additional definitions

### Objects and Arrays
Objects are lists of Key and Value pairs, or arrays of Key and Value pairs.

Key value pairs are lists of keys such as ‘Age’ and Values such as ‘30’. 

Keys are always strings but values are of variable types such as strings, integers, booleans, arrays.

Objects are delineated by { } (scientifically known squiggly brackets), while Arrays are delineated by [ ] (scientifically known as not as squiggly brackets)

### Architect Built-in Variables
Architect has a list of native variables that are referencable within architect flows without having to invoke a data action to pull the data. 
If you’re preparing to construct a data action to gather any item such as the conversation ID of a call entering a flow, check the built-in variables page to see if it is natively available!
