Now that we have covered the basics of what a Data action is and how API calls are structured, we will work torwards the configuration components of an API (Data Action). In the next steps we will be working hands on in building your data action integration within your Genesys cloud org, authenticating the integration, and creating a schema to which your data action will call against. 

In this section we will -
  * Find and execute a call from the Genesys Cloud Developer Center
  * Use JSON path tools to parse the responses for the data we're looking for
  * Create an OAuth Client and Install the Data Actions Integration
  * Use the Data Action constructor to build our first API Call
